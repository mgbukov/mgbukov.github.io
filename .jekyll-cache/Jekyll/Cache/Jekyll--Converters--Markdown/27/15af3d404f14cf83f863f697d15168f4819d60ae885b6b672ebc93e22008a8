I"T<p>We present evidence for a universal <strong>spin-glass-like transition in the quantum control landscape</strong>, controlled by the control protocol duration. The glassy critical point is marked by a proliferation of protocols with close-to-optimal fidelity and with an optimal protocol that appears exponentially difficult to find.</p>
