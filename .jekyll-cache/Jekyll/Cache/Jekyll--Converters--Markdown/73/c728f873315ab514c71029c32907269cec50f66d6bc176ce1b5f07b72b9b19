<p>A major challenge in the quest for developing reliable quantum computing architectures is the ability to achieve high-precision quantum state control. To address this problem, a variety of optimal control algorithms have been developed. In our study, we reveal that the complexity of preparing correlated many-body states [see Fig, panel (a)] quickly and with high fidelity, can undergo drastic changes resembling phase transitions. We map the quantum control problem to a classical Ising model and apply concepts of statistical physics [see Fig, panels (b),(d)] in order to analyze the properties of these phase transitions of quantum control. In particular, we show strong evidence for the onset of a glass-like phase due to an underlying extremely rugged quantum control landscape [see Fig, panel (c)]. Using the machine learning technique t-SNE, we further show that the control transitions exhibit clustering in the space of local infidelity minima, a phenomenon familiar from spin-glass physics. This allows us to ultimately make a connection between quantum control and constrained satisfiability problems, which can be used to quantify the feasibility of optimal quantum control. <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.10856">Our study</a> provides an exciting new direction of research in the area of overlap between nonequilibrium quantum dynamics, statistical physics, and machine learning.</p>
