I am a research group leader at the Max Planck Institute for the Physics of Complex Systems in Dresden Germany. Check out the <a href="https://www.pks.mpg.de/nqd"><strong>website of our group</strong></a>. 
<!-- I am currently a Junior Group Leader and Marie Sklodowska-Curie fellow at the Physics Department, Sofia University. I study the dynamics of many-body quantum and classical systems away from equilibrium.
My research focusses on Condensed Matter Physics, Ultracold Atoms, Statistical Mechanics, and the interplay between Machine Learning and Physics. -->
