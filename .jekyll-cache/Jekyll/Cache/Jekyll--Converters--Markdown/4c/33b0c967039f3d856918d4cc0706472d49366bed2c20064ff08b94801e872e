I"–<p>A <strong><em>Reinforcement Learning</em></strong> agent figures out how to <strong><em>Control Floquet-Engineered Quantum States</em></strong> in a numerical simulation of a quantum experiment. The ability of RL to control systems far away from equilibrium is demonstrated by steering the quantum Kapitza oscillator into the stabilized inverted position in the presence of a strong periodic drive.</p>
