I"u<p>Floquet engineering is an established technique from the quantum simulation toolbox, with the present bottleneck set by unwanted heating. We study the occurrence of <strong><em>Parametric Instabilities in Weakly-Interacting Bosonic Optical Lattices</em></strong>, and showcase the detrimental effects caused by transverse degrees of freedom and weak harmonic traps.</p>
