I"È<p>A physical way to characterize the complexity of preparing quantum states is the <strong>quantum speed limit</strong> â€“ the minimal time required to prepare a target state with unit fidelity. We formulated a <strong>Conjecture</strong> according to which, for any protocol within the space of available controls, the time-integrated energy fluctuations are bounded from below by the adiabatic geodesic length between the initial and final states.</p>
