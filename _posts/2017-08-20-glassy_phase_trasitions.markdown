We present evidence for a universal **spin-glass-like transition in the quantum control landscape**, controlled by the control protocol duration. The glassy critical point is marked by a proliferation of protocols with close-to-optimal fidelity and with an optimal protocol that appears exponentially difficult to find.

A major challenge in the quest for developing reliable quantum computing architectures is the ability to achieve high-precision quantum state control. To address this problem, a variety of optimal control algorithms have been developed. In our study, we reveal that the complexity of preparing correlated many-body states [see Fig, panel (a)] quickly and with high fidelity, can undergo drastic changes resembling phase transitions. We map the quantum control problem to a classical Ising model and apply concepts of statistical physics [see Fig, panels (b),(d)] in order to analyze the properties of these phase transitions of quantum control. In particular, we show strong evidence for the onset of a glass-like phase due to an underlying extremely rugged quantum control landscape [see Fig, panel (c)]. Using the machine learning technique t-SNE, we further show that the control transitions exhibit clustering in the space of local infidelity minima, a phenomenon familiar from spin-glass physics. This allows us to ultimately make a connection between quantum control and constrained satisfiability problems, which can be used to quantify the feasibility of optimal quantum control. [Our study](https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.10856) provides an exciting new direction of research in the area of overlap between nonequilibrium quantum dynamics, statistical physics, and machine learning.
