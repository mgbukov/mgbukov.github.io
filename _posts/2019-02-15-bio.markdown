### Welcome to my homepage!
<br>
I am currently a Gordon and Betty Moore postdoctoral research fellow at the Physics Department, University of California (Berkeley). I study the dynamics of many-body quantum and classical systems away from equilibrium.
My research focusses on Condensed Matter Physics, Ultracold Atoms, Statistical Mechanics, and the interplay between Machine Learning and Physics.
