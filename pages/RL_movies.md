On this page, you can find the supplementary videos to the paper [Reinforcement Learning in Different Phases of Quantum Control](https://arxiv.org/abs/1705.00565) <span style="color:blue">[1]</span>. 

For the single qubit, we present three movies showing protocols found by the Reinforcement Learning (RL) agent (Videos 1-3) and three moves for the one-parameter variational protocols (Videos 4-6) for ramp durations $T=0.5, 1.0, 3.0$, respectively. The target state on the Bloch sphere is shown in red, while the instantaneous state - in green. The protocol time step size is $\\delta t=0.05$. 

The final two movies show the learning dynamics in for a single qubit for $T= 2.4$ (Video 7), and a ten coupled qubit system for $T=4.0$ (Video 8).


* __Single qubit protocols learned by the RL agent__. Videos 1-3 show the protocols found by the RL agent for a single qubit for protocol durations of $T=0.5, 1.0, 3.0$, respectively: [Video 1]({{site.baseurl}}../movies/RL_paper/Video-1.mp4), [Video 2]({{site.baseurl}}../movies/RL_paper/Video-2.mp4), [Video 3]({{site.baseurl}}../movies/RL_paper/Video-3.mp4).

* __Single qubit variational protocols__. Videos 4-6 show variational protocols inspired found by the RL agent for a single qubit for protocol durations of $T=0.5, 1.0, 3.0$, respectively: [Video 4]({{site.baseurl}}../movies/RL_paper/Video-4.mp4), [Video 5]({{site.baseurl}}../movies/RL_paper/Video-5.mp4), [Video 6]({{site.baseurl}}../movies/RL_paper/Video-6.mp4).

* __Learning dynamics__. Videos 7-8 shows the learning dynamics of the single qubuit with $T=2.4$ and ten coupled qubits with $T=3.0$, respectively. The reward in the manybody Video 8, $\tilde F_h(T) = 1/L\log F_h(T)$, can be thought of as the fidelity per site: [Video 7]({{site.baseurl}}../movies/RL_post/qubit.mp4), [Video 8]({{site.baseurl}}../movies/RL_post/many_qubits.mp4).
