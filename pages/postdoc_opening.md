*Applications are now open for a <span style="color:blue">**VIHREN postdoc fellowship**</span> (see also [job ad for PhDs]({{site.baseurl}}/PhD_opening/)).* 


We are currently looking for a highly motivated and skilled postdoc/experienced researcher to join a new research group at Sofia University. The group is funded by a VIHREN research frontier grant from the Bulgarian National Science Foundation, and a Marie Sklodowska-Curie actions grant from the European Commission's Research Executive Agency. The group maintains an active <span style="color:blue">**network of international collaborations**</span> with leading groups in the field [Berkeley, Boston, Brussels, Harvard, Munich, etc.].


We are interested in a broad range of topics revolving around the field of quantum many-body systems **[non-equilibrium quantum dynamics, condensed matter theory (phase transitions, critical phenomena), AMO physics, and statistical physics]**, developing techniques and ideas from **Deep Learning** for quantum systems; we are looking for applicants of diverse scientific background. Our research results are applicable in experimental platforms, e.g., ultracold atoms, trapped ions, and superconducting circuits. Concrete examples of past projects can be found on [https://mgbukov.github.io/](https://mgbukov.github.io/).


Applicants are expected to (i) have research experience in one or more of the above-listed fields, and (ii) be prepared to expand their knowledge through active, full-time research. The postdocotoral fellow will be encouraged to become an independent researcher through interactions with the group, following an individual career development plan. The working language in the group is English. By the end of their fellowship, VIHREN postdoc fellows will develop a broad research expertise useful to pursue a career in both academia and industry.


VIHREN postdoc <span style="color:blue">**fellowship benefits**</span>:
* very competitive salary
* laptop
* travel budget for participation in international conferences, workshops and schools
* opportunities for collaboration with an international network of leading scientists in the field, and local experts

<span style="color:blue">**Research**</span> problems will be chosen at the interface of far-from-equilibrium many-body dynamics (theoretical physics) and deep reinforcement learning (machine learning). The obtained results are expected to be applicable in experimental platforms, such as ultracold atoms, trapped ions, and superconducting circuits. Concrete projects will be chosen together by the VIHREN postdoc fellow and the supervisor, and may involve a combination of: <br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (i)   building analytical descriptions and approximate theories for understanding nonequilibrium many-body states of matter [e.g., periodically-driven systems, Floquet engineering, pre-thermalization and thermalization in integrable and nonintegrable models, quantum control and manipulation of exotic many-body states of matter, optimization landscapes and their complexity, etc.], and <br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (ii)   developing deep reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms specifically taylored for quantum systems [e.g., applying and assessing the performance of recent RL algorithmic breakthroughs to manipulate quantum systems, developing new hybrid RL-quantum control techniques specifically designed to interact with quantum systems, etc.]. <br/>
Concrete examples of past projects can be found on my website [https://mgbukov.github.io/](https://mgbukov.github.io/). By the end of their fellowship, VIHREN postdoc fellows will develop a broad research expertise useful to pursue a career in both academia and industry.

The group has active <span style="color:blue">**international collaborations**</span> with leading groups in the field [Berkeley, Boston, Brussels, Harvard, Munich, etc.], which the succesful applicant will be able to participate in. Additionally, there are opportunities for strong local collaborations at the Faculty of Physics [e.g., the [Quantum Optics and Quantum Information Group](http://quantum-bg.org/group/)], and multiple institutes of the Bulgarian Academy of Sciences (BAS). 
VIHREN postdoc fellows will also have a travel budget to participate in conferences, schools, and workshops. 

Research projects in the group involve writing scientific code and performing numerical simulations. Therefore, a solid knowledge of a **programing language** (e.g., Python, C++, or similar) is required. Familiarity with at least one **quantum mechanics library** [e.g., QuTip, QuSpin, TeNPy, iTensor, NetKet], ***or*** at least one **machine learning package** [e.g., TenforFlow, PyTorch, JAX], ***or*** relevant coding experience is **required**. Familiarty with parallel programming [e.g., OpenMP, Open MPI, CUDA, etc.] will be **considered an advantage**. The supervisor is one of the developers of [QuSpin](http://weinbe58.github.io/QuSpin/), and postdocs can participate in scientific software development. 

The group has access to the three hpc clusters: [Physon](http://physon.phys.uni-sofia.bg/about-physon-en), [Nestum](http://hpc-lab.sofiatech.bg/home/) and the hpc at the [Center of Excellence in Informatics and Information and Communication Technologies](http://ict.acad.bg/?page_id=41), BAS. The successful postdoc applicant will be provided with a laptop as part of the VIHREN fellowship.

Scientific  <span style="color:blue">**activities in the group**</span> will include a weekly group meeting to discuss recent progress in the field, and participation in journal clubs and seminars on topics of common interest. Group members may also be asked to help with the teaching activities the group is involved in. To build a friendly and productive working environment, VIHREN fellows -- as an integral part of the group --  will be cordially invited to join in non-scientific activities [Sofia lies in between Vitosha mountain and the Balkan mountains which provide many opportunities for outdoor activities, and enjoy a four-season weather].
