***Requirement***: successful applicants must hold a Master degree or its equivalent at the start date of the job.


Applications are now open for a <span style="color:blue">**VIHREN PhD fellowship**</span> (see also [job ad for postdocs]( {{site.baseurl}}/postdoc_opening/)).



We are currently looking for highly motivated and skilled students to join a new research group at Sofia University. The group is interested in a broad range of topics revolving around the field of quantum many-body systems **[non-equilibrium quantum dynamics, condensed matter theory (phase transitions, critical phenomena), AMO physics, and statistical physics]**, developing techniques and ideas from **Deep Learning** for quantum systems. The students ares expected to engage in active, full-time research, and work towards obtaining a PhD degree; they will be actively supervised by the principal investigator M. Bukov. The working language in the group is English.


The <span style="color:blue">**PhD thesis topic**</span> will be at the interface of far-from-equilibrium many-body dynamics (theoretical physics) and deep reinforcement learning (machine learning). The obtained results are expected to be applicable in experimental platforms, such as ultracold atoms, trapped ions, and superconducting circuits. The precise project will be selected based on the student's preferences and can involve a combination of: <br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (i)   building analytical descriptions and approximate theories for understanding nonequilibrium many-body states of matter [e.g., periodically-driven systems, Floquet engineering, pre-thermalization and thermalization in integrable and nonintegrable models, quantum control and manipulation of exotic many-body states of matter, optimization landscapes and their complexity, etc.], and <br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (ii)   developing deep reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms specifically taylored for quantum systems [e.g., applying and assessing the performance of recent RL algorithmic breakthroughs to manipulate quantum systems, developing new hybrid RL-quantum control techniques specifically designed to interact with quantum systems, etc.]. <br/>
Concrete examples of past projects can be found on my website [https://mgbukov.github.io/](https://mgbukov.github.io/). By the time of their graduation, VIHREN PhD fellows will develop an in-depth research expertise, and a number of high-demand skills useful to pursue a career in both academia and industry.

The group maintains an active <span style="color:blue">**network of international collaborations**</span> with leading groups in the field [Berkeley, Boston, Brussels, Harvard, Munich, etc.], which the succesful applicant will be able to participate in. Additionally, there are opportunities for strong local collaborations at the Faculty of Physics [e.g., the [Quantum Optics and Quantum Information Group](http://quantum-bg.org/group/)], and multiple institutes of the Bulgarian Academy of Sciences (BAS). 
VIHREN PhD fellows will also have multiple opportunities to participate in conferences, schools, and workshops during their PhD. 


The PhD project will involve writing scientific code and performing numerical simulations (although the extent to which simulations will be used can vary, depending on interests). Therefore, basic knowledge of a programing language (such as Mathematica, Matlab, Python, C++, or similar) is required (except for analytical projects but then the student will be expected to pick up coding quickly). Familiarity with a quantum mechanics package [QuTip, QuSpin, TeNPy, iTensor, NetKet, etc.], or a machine learning package [TenforFlow, PyTorch, JAX, etc.] is not required but will be ***considered an advantage***. The PhD advisor is one of the developers of [QuSpin](http://weinbe58.github.io/QuSpin/), and interested students can participate in scientific software development. 

The group has access to the three hpc clusters: [Physon](http://physon.phys.uni-sofia.bg/about-physon-en), [Nestum](http://hpc-lab.sofiatech.bg/home/) and the hpc at the [Center of Excellence in Informatics and Information and Communication Technologies](http://ict.acad.bg/?page_id=41 ), BAS. Hence, successful applicants will have the opprtunity to learn state-of-the-art high-performance computing techniques and practices. The PhD student will, therefore, be provided with a laptop as part of the VIHREN fellowship.

Scientific  <span style="color:blue">**activities in the group**</span> will include a weekly group meeting to discuss recent progress in the field, and participation in journal clubs and seminars on topics of common interest. Group members may also be asked to help with the teaching activities the group is involved in. To build a friendly and productive working environment, VIHREN fellows -- as an integral part of the group --  will be cordially invited to join in non-scientific activities [Sofia lies in between Vitosha mountain and the Balkan mountains which provide many opportunities for outdoor activities, and enjoy a four-season weather].


VIHREN PhD <span style="color:blue">**fellowship benefits**</span>:
* generous stipend
* laptop
* participation in international conferences, workshops and schools
* opportunities for collaboration with an international network of leading scientists in the field, and local experts


VIHREN PhD **fellows are expected to enrol as PhD students**. The stipend covers the PhD program tuition fees for [EU/EEA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Economic_Area) students; non-EU/EEA students should also check the additional criteria for enrolling in a PhD program at Sofia University.



*We strongly encourage both physics majors with interest in machine learning, and science majors with knowledge of quantum mechanics to apply for the VIHREN PhD fellowship! Generally, as long as you have a strong interest and background knowledge in some of the topics listed above, we will give serious consideration to your application, even if your major is not physics.*



Interested applicants should send the following <span style="color:blue">**Application Materials**</span> to Marin Bukov at *mgbukov(#)phys.uni-sofia.bg*. Please, ***use the subject line*** "VIHREN PhD fellowship application": <br/>
1) CV (emphasize those strengths and skills relevant for this PhD position), <br/>
2) the names and e-mail contacts of three Referees willing to send letters of recommendation, <br/>
3) transcript of records for your bachelor and master studies, and (if not present therein) a list of audit-only classes. <br/>

Competitive applicants will be invited for an interview. This position will remain open until filled, but we will have more openings in the following years. The position is open as part of the research project “Reinforcement Learning to Manipulate Quantum Matter away from Equilibrium”, funded by a VIHREN frontier research grant from the Bulgarian National Science Foundation.



*<span style="color:blue">**Sofia University "St. Clement of Ohrid"**</span> is the oldest research university in Bulgaria and one of the largest in south-east Europe, with about 20,000 students. Situated within walking distance from downtown [Sofia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sofia) in Sofia University's Lozenets campus, the Faculty of Physics hosts [research groups](https://www.uni-sofia.bg/index.php/eng/the_university/faculties/faculty_of_physics2/departments) in various areas of modern physics, and has been enjoying the most productive research environment in Bulgaria [340 publications/yr. (Web of Science) in 2018]. The Quantum Optics and Quantum Information theory group hosts the annual workshop [CAMEL](http://camel16.quantum-bg.org/) (Control of quantum dynamics of Atoms, Molecules and Ensembles by Light). 
The Faculty of Physics shares campus with the Faculty of Mathematics & Informatics, and the Faculty of Chemistry & Pharmacy, providing opportunities for interdisciplinary collaborations. The Bulgarian capital Sofia also hosts the institutes for Solid State Physics and Informatics, and Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) at the [Bulgarian Academy of Sciences](http://www.bas.bg/en/), with groups interested in condensed matter, quantum optics, and ML/big data.*
